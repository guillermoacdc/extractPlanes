Assumptions: 
	efficient RANSAC and PCL have been installed in the path /usr/local/include/
	source files are available

2. create a folder for the project with name extractPlanes. Add two sub folders: (1) src, (2) build

3. copy two files to src folder: CMakeLists.txt, extractPlanes.cpp

4. Modify the parameter tao in efficient RANSAC implementation with value 50
//was set by updating the constructor in RansacShapeDetector.cpp lines 25, 32
//remember to ask edit permission:   sudo -H gedit /usr/local/include/ransac/RansacShapeDetector.cpp

5. build the project from build folder
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ../src

6. create the binares from build folder using
make

7. compiling Test from terminal

inputs:
	dataPath
	frame
	distanceTreshold

example creating map of planes from frame 5; command executed from build folder
./extractPlanes /home/guillermo/Documents/ptCloudsData/scene5/ 5 0.01

Assumptions: all the data sources are populated

---------------compiling from Eclipse

6. open the project in eclipse

7. create a new run configuration: Eclipse/Run/Run Configurations/C C++ Application/New

8. if necessary update the input/output paths in extractPlanes.cpp and run the project
